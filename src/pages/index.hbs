        You won't find any ads, AI chatbots, or fancy algorithms designed for maximum profit. Instead, what you'll find here are pages that have been collected by a <i>real human (<a href="{{seo.authorURL}}">this human!</a>)</i> based on their own interests, pet peeves, and foibles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Think of it as less of a "search engine", and more of a "search bicycle".</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you search, this page will return <b>only pages from the collection which contain the text you searched for</b>, in order of <b>how many times that text appears on the page</b>. That's it.
